*"Design a stunning, futuristic 3D black-themed website for a nonprofit organization called Beacon of Hope 🤍🕊. The site should feel deeply creative, immersive, and emotionally powerful.

Use a black background with glowing 3D elements — like floating doves, luminous ribbons, soft particle animations, and abstract light waves — to symbolize compassion, healing, and strength. The mood should be hopeful yet modern, like a galaxy of kindness.
